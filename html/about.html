        <h2>Ball U Ultimate</h2>
        <p>The Ball State Men's Ultimate team is an active and competitive group of guys that love ultimate and love teaching others about Ultimate. We've been around for a long while now, and we're always looking for new members to share our love of the sport with. This past season we had a great turn out with over 8 new members. But if you're interested now, don't hesitate to join; middle of the season or not, new potential members are always more than welcome to come out to practices! </p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Ball State Men's Ultimate has a rich history unique only to itself. Just ask any alumni: BSU Ultimate is a special and awesome thing. Beginning around 1979, the team was once a seemingly rag time group of dudes that just loved to play Ultimate. This team ravaged Indiana for many years though, claiming many state championship titles.</p>
        <p>Here at Ball U, our local tournament every year is States Tournament. A one day tournament, the most exciting game of the event is almost always the current Ball State Ultimate team versus our own alumni. The match always proves to be a great learning experience for the new members, and a great reunion for the past members and even some of the older current members as they face their old teammates.</p>
        <p>A full BSU Ultimate history is still in the making, so try checking back later to learn more!</p>
