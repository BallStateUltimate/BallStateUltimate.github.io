        <h2>Ball U Ultimate</h2>
        <p>The Ball State Men's Ultimate team is an active and competitive group of guys that love ultimate and love teaching others about Ultimate. We've been around for a long while now, and we're always looking for new members to share our love of the sport with. This past season we had a great turn out with over 8 new members. But if you're interested now, don't hesitate to join; middle of the season or not, new potential members are always more than welcome to come out to practices! </p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Ball State Men's Ultimate has a rich history unique only to itself. Just ask any alumni: BSU Ultimate is a special and awesome thing. Beginning around 1979, the team was once a seemingly rag time group of dudes that just loved to play Ultimate. This team ravaged Indiana for many years though, claiming many state championship titles. Oh, and did I mention the original name was the Ball State Wizardz?</p>
        <p>While the name 'Wizardz' has recently been set aside for restriction reasons, many alumni (including recent ones) still claim the title to be the Ball State Wizardz. Every year at States Tournament right here in Muncie, the alumnus show up to prove just how great Ultiamte is, and to also prove the Wizardz Never Die.</p>
        <p>A full BSU Ultimate history is in the making, but if you're interested to learn more, check out some of the old Ultimate websites!</p>
